# Day 3
This day was quite the mess. Started out with a template from yesterday but that only proved to help a small amount with setup of the node+typescript project. It also hurt as I missed things that I accidentally assumed. Also, misread the prompt again... Also also, I really need to do TDD better. I'm writing the test cases after fleshing out the code and thats not supposed to be how TDD works...
