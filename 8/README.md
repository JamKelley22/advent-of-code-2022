# 8

Today's challenge was much more fun than yesterday's challenge. I think that was partly because I did less to overcomplicated the question by building up these data structures that were not necessary. If a tree data structure is implied than I will likely use that especially with the promise of an unknown part 2 on the horizon.

I'm sure there was some mathematical way to solve today's challenge but I ended up with a rather literal solution. I also forwent implementing some of the edge case functionality since I knew the final input parameters and bounds.

I do enjoy the building on each part as I eat the whole problem. First figuring out a single row then applying that to all rows and cols. That was one thing that I found cool, getting the column of a 2d array and just operating on it the same way that I did the rows.
